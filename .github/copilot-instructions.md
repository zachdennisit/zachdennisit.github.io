Project: ZachDennisIt static site

Purpose
- Small static personal website built from plain HTML files (no build toolchain).

Quick summary for contributors and AI agents
- This repo serves static pages: `index.html`, `about.html`, and other HTML files. Styling comes from `pico.min.css` (local) or an optional CDN reference in `index.html`.
- There is no JS build, package.json, or tests — preview and edits are done by serving the files locally.

Key files and patterns
- `index.html`: landing page; may reference the Pico CDN.
- `about.html`: example page showing the bottom navigation pattern used across pages:
  - The nav block (links to `index.html`, `projects.html`, `resume.html`, `contact.html`) is duplicated in pages — update all copies when changing nav.
- `contact` (notice: file has no `.html` extension): inconsistent with nav links that expect `contact.html`. Check filenames and relative links before editing.
- `pico.min.css`: local copy of Pico.css used for offline styling.

Project-specific guidance for AI agents
- Modify HTML only; preserve the simple, minimal structure and relative links.
- When adding or renaming pages, update every page's nav footer. Example: if creating `contact.html`, rename the existing `contact` file to `contact.html` and change links in `about.html` and other pages to match.
- Keep styling consistent by linking to `pico.min.css` (prefer the local file for offline parity). `index.html` optionally uses the CDN — keep both approaches consistent when editing.

Preview / developer workflow
- No build step. To preview locally, run a static server from the repo root, for example:

```bash
python -m http.server 8000
# or
npx serve . -l 8000
```

Editing conventions and examples
- Title/meta: update the `<title>` in the page head (e.g., `About Me | Zach Dennis`) and keep `<meta name="viewport">` present for mobile.
- Navigation example (from `about.html`):

```html
<p>
  <a href="index.html">Home</a> |
  <a href="projects.html">Projects</a> |
  <a href="resume.html">Resume</a> |
  <a href="contact.html">Contact</a>
</p>
```

- If you fix the `contact` filename mismatch: rename the file and update any links pointing to `contact.html` or `contact` to use the final filename.

What *not* to change
- Do not introduce a JS build system or transpilers unless the repo owner requests it. This site is intentionally minimal.

When in doubt
- Preserve relative paths and the minimal Pico CSS approach.
- If you add any new pages, mirror the existing HTML structure and update nav links across all pages.

Ask the owner before:
- Replacing the local `pico.min.css` with a different framework.
- Converting the site to a static site generator or adding a build tool.

If something is unclear
- Ask: do you want `.html` extensions enforced for all pages? Should we consolidate Pico usage to the CDN or the local file?
