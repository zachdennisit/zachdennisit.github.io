  <h1>About Me</h1>

  <p>
    I’m an IT-focused professional with a strong interest in systems,
    networking, and practical problem-solving. I enjoy working hands-on
    with technology and learning how things work under the hood. I am 
    currently studying at WGU pursuing my Bachelor's in Information Technology.
  </p>

  <p>
    I’m currently focused on building strong IT fundamentals, including
    operating systems, networking concepts, and troubleshooting.
    I value clear documentation and learning skills that apply to
    real-world environments.
  </p>

  <p>
    This website serves as a central place for my projects, labs,
    and experience as I continue growing in the IT field.
